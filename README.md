# Bones

Bones provides conventions for [Backbone](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) applications. It allows most code to be shared on the server and the client. Bones exposes your Backbone controller routes as regular paths on the server so they can be accessed by non-JavaScript agents, while capable clients can enjoy the normal client-side Backbone experience.
